coverage on git as well as the docker only work, when the Gui part from main is commented out, as both are headless and have no X11

# Monopoly written in Scala 3

# Usage
`sbt test` runs the tests (I hope they all work),
You can compile code with `sbt compile`,
run it with `sbt run`,
and `sbt console` will start a Scala 3 REPL.
